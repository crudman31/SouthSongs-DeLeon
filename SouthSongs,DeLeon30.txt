To the Exchanged Prisoners.

To the Exchanged Prisoners.
The anchors are weighed, and the gates of your
prison
Fall wide, as your ship gives her prow to the
foam,
And a few hurried hours shall return you exulting,
Where the flag you have fought for floats over 
your home.
•
God send that not long may its fold be uplifited
O'er fields dark and sad with the trial of the 
fight-
God give it the triumph He always hath given,
Or sooner or later, to Valor and Right!
•
But if peace may not yet wreath your homes with
her olive,
And new victims are still round the alter to 
bleed,
God shielf you amid the red bolts of the battle!
God give you stour hearts fir high thought and
brave deed!
