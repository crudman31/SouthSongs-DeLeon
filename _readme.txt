The metadata I included in my excel file is as follows: Page Number, Label, Image URL, 	Original File URL, Height, Width, 
Suggested File Name, Page Tiff, Title of Work, and Author. There is a few reasons I included this, and not other metadata, 
however, the primary reason is that I am not entirely confident in my digital abilities (in this assignment and beyond), and this 
was the information that when reviewing the manifest in Visual Studio Code that was the most apparent. I wanted to add more 
nuanced metadata, such as content tags of the information on the page or linktrees, however, I was not able to do this, as it is 
quite outside the scope of my abilities.
