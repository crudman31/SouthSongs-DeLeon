The metadata I included in my excel file is as follows: Page Number, Label, Image URL, 	Original File URL, Height, Width, 
Suggested File Name, Page Tiff, Title of Work, and Author. There is a few reasons I included this, and not other metadata, 
however, the primary reason is that I am not entirely confident in my digital abilities (in this assignment and beyond), and this 
was the information that when reviewing the manifest in Visual Studio Code that was the most apparent. I wanted to add more 
nuanced metadata, such as content tags of the information on the page or linktrees, however, I was not able to do this, as it is 
quite outside the scope of my abilities. 

OCRing and Cleaning
I had a deceptively difficult time with OCRing and cleaning my text. Why it was deceptive is that my text is a book of poems, 
thus I expected for it to be fairly simple to OCR. However, the tool had difficulty, most likely due to the type that was used to
print the work, and continuously was unable to read Ms, Ns, Ls, as well as randomly was unable to decipher some other letters. 
Further, on the top of each page was the name of the poem in a special, fancier type, which the OCRing could not decipher. 
Furthermore, one of the pages I OCRed was the table of contents, which has many commas and periods separating the name of the poem 
from the writer, which, when copied and pasted over, required a lot of time and effort to clean and make cohesive. As we discussed in 
class, the various spacing, italics, and emphasis that was given to the poems was completely removed through the process of OCRing, 
leaving the poems to feel far more flat, but figuratively and literally. I did not have any images that needed to be dealt with, but
overall the process of OCRing was far more challenging than I previously thought, as the video made it appear deceptively simple, and
I now understand some of the difficulties individuals face while undergoing this process, and how it can present many challenges. For 
example, when there were various spacing issues, extra punctuation, etc, I was forced to make certain decisions of how to best 
reflect this in the text, which inherently left my mark on the text in profound and lasting ways.
