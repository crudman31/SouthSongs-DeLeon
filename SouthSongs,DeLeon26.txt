The Guerrillas.
____
And His blight would wither our manhood,
If we smoke not the smiter again.
•
"By the graves where out fathers slumber,
By the shrines where out mothers prayed,
By our homes, and hopes, and freedom,
Let every man swear on his blade-
•
"That he will not sheath nor stay it
Till from point to heft it glow,
With the flush of Almightly vengeance,
In the blood of the felon foe!"
•
They swore; and the answering sunlight
Leapt red from their lifted swords,
And the ahte in their hearts made echo
To the wrath in their burning words!
•
There's weeping in all New-England,
And by Schuylkill's bank a knell;
Amd the widows there, and the orphans,
How the oath was kept can tell.
