Your Mission
____
As she chaunts of a glory which vastly
Transcends all the horrors of war.
•
Pause here by this bedside-how mellow
The light showers down on that brow!
Such a brave, brawny visage! Poor fellow!
Some homestead is missing him now:
Some wife shades her eyes in the clearing,
Some mother sits moaning distressed,
While the loved one lies faint, but unfearing
With the enemy's ball in his breast.
•
Here's another; a lad-a mere strupling-
Picked up on the field, almost dead,
With the blood through his sunny hair rippling
From a horrible gash in the head.
They say he was first in the action,
Gay-hearted, quick-handed, and witty;
He fought, till he fell with exhuastion,
At the gates of our fair Southern city.
•
Fought and fell 'neath the guns of that city,
With a spirit transcending his years.
Lift him up, in your large-hearted pity,
And wet his pale lips with your tears.
