The Long Sentry.
____
Richmond and Sharpsburgh thundered by,
With that tremendous fight
That gave him the angel host,
Who watched the camp that night.
•
We mourn for him, who died for us,
With one resistless moan,
While up the Valley of the Lord
He marches to the Throne!
He kept the faith of men and saints
Sublime, and pure, and bright;
He sleeps-and all is well with him
Who watched the camp that night.
•
Brothers! the midnight of the cuase
Is shrouded in our fate-
The demon Goths pollute our halls
With fire, and list, and hate!
Be strong-be valiant-be assured-
Strike home for Heaven and Right!
The sould of Jackson stalks abroad,
and gaurds the camp to-night!
