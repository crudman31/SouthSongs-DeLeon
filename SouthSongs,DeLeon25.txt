The Guerrillas.

And pray for lust's kingdom to come!
•
"To saddle! to saddle! my brothers!
Look up to the rising sun,
And ask of the God who shines there,
Whether deeds like these shall be done.
•
"Wherever the vandal cometh,
Press home to his heart with your steel:
And where'er at his bosom ye can not,
Like the serpent, go strike at his heel.
•
"Through thicket and wood go hunt him;
Creep up to his camp-fire side!
And let ten of his corpses blacken
Where one of our brothers hath died!
•
"In his fainting, foot-sore marches,
In his flight from the stricken fray,
In the snare of the linely ambush,
The debts that we owe him, pay!
•
"In God's hand alone is judgment,
But He strikes with the hands of men,
