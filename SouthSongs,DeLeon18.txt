Your Mission
____
There's need of your delicate finger,
For your womanly sympathy, there.
These are sick ones, athirst for caressing-
There are dying ones, raving of home-
There are wounds to be bound with a blessing-
And shrouds to make ready for some.
•
They have gathered about you the harvest
Of death, in its ghastliest view;
The nearest, as well as the farthest,
Is here with the traitor and true!
And crowned with your beautiful patience,
Made sunny, with love at the heart,
You must balsam the wounds of a nation,
Nor falter, nor shrink from your part!
•
Up and down, through the wards, where the fever
Stalks noisome, and gaunt, and impure,
You must go, with your steadfast endeavor,
To comfort, to counsel, to cure!
I grant that the task's superhuman,
But strength will be given to you
To do for these dear ones what woman
Alone in her pity can do.
