The Guerrillas.
____
I've seen, where the little children
Sank down in the furrows, to die!
•
"On the banks of the battle-stained river
I stood, as the moonlight shone,
And it glared on the face of my brother,
As the sad wave swept him on!
•
"Where my home was glad, are ashes,
And horror and shame had been there;
For I found, on the fallen lintel,
This tress of my wife's torn hair!
•
"They are turning the slave upon us,
And ith more than the fiend's worst art,
Have uncovered the fires of the savage,
That slept in his untaught heart!
•
"The ties to our hearths that bound him,
They have rent, with curses, away,
And maddended him, with their madness, 
To be almost as brutal as they.
•
With halter, and torch, and Bible,
And hymns, to the sound of the drum,
