To the Exchanged Prisoners.
____
No need we should bid you go strike for your 
freedom-
You have stricken, like men, for its blessings 
before,
And your homes and your loved ones, your wrongs
and your manhood,
Will nerve you to fight the good fight o'er and
o'er!
•
But will you not think, as you wave your glad ban-
ners,
How the flag of old Maryland, trodden in shame,
Lies sullied and torn in the dust of her highways-
And will you not strike a fresh blow in her name?
•
Her mothers have sent their first-born to be with
you,
Wherever with blood there are fields to be won-
Her daughters have wept for you, clad you and 
nursed you-
Their vows and their hopes and their smiles are
your own.
•
Let her cause be your cause, and whenever the 
war-cry
Bids you rish to the field,oh! remember her too-
