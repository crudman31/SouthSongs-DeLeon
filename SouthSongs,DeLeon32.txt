To the Exchanged Prisoners.
____
And when freedom and peace shall be blended in 
glory,
Oh! count it your shame if she be not with you.
â€¢
And if in the hour when pride, honor, and duty,
Shall stir every throb in the hearts of brave men,
The wrongs of the helpless can quicken such pulses,
Let the captives at Warren give flame to them
then.
