Preface.
vive a bitterness now buried and still. To these irrationals 
I have no word to say. I ask no favor at their hands, having
sufficent confidence in my adopted children to trust them to
stand alone.
If poems, born of revoultion, bore no marks of the bitter
neds that crished them from the hearts of their authors, they
would have no value whatever, intrinsic or historical.
The feelings that prompted them live no longer. The SOuth
put her cause in the hands of the God of Battles. She has
made no murmur since his decree was spoken.
A people who have accepted the inevitable with the dignified 
quiet of hers, can be taught no wrong by the repeition, in
perfect peace, of words spoken to them while yet in the heat
of a bitter struggle.
The effect of the war has been to raise the Southern charac-
ter in the opinion of the North; and the feeling that the South
is a conquered province-abject and bound-is fast dying out 
in the breadth of the land. These poems may aid in this
good work; but read at every fireside on the South, they are
to-day as harmless as the "Lays of Ancient Rome."
Their authors, whatever they may have been, are now simply 
private citizens. I shall not invade their sancta to search for
the motives that impelled them. That they wrote honestly,
none who read their words can dobut; and I am well content
to leave them in the hands of the public, saying only:
"By their works shall ye know them."
