The Burtial of Latane.
____
Let us not weep for him, whose deeds endure!
So young, so brave, so beautiful! He died
As he had wished to die; the past is sure;
Whatever yet of sorrow may betide
Those who still linger by the stormy shore,
Change can not harm him now, nor fortune
touch him more.

And when Virginia, leaning on her spear,
Victrix et Vidua-the conflict done-
Shall raise her mailed hand to wipe the tear
That starts, as she recalls each martyred son,
No prouder memory her breast shall sway
Than thine, our early lost, lamented Latané!
