The Long Sentry.
____
The Lone Sentry.
'Twas as the dying of the day,
The darkness grew so still;
The drowsy pipe of evening birds
Was hushed upon the hill.
Athwart the shadows of the vale
Slumbered the men of might;
And one lone sentry paced his rounds
To watch the camp that night.
•
A grave and solemn man was he,
With deep and sombre brow;
The dreamful eyes seemed hoarding up
Some unaccomplished vow.
The wistful glance peered o'er the plan,
Beneath the starry light;
And, with the murmured name of God,
He watched the camp that night.
•
The future open unto him
Its grand and awful scroll-
Manassas and the valley march
Came heaving o'er his soul;
