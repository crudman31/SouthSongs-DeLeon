The Burtial of Latane.

The Burtial of Latané
The combat raged not long, but ours the day;
And, through the hosts that compassed us around,
Our little band rode proudly on its way,
Leaving one gallant comrade, glory-crowned,
Unburied on the field he died to gain-
Single of all his men, amind the histile slain.
•
One moment on the battle's edge he stood-
Hope's halo, like a helmet, round his hair-
The next beheld him, dabbled in his blood,
Prostrate in death; and yet, in death how fair!
Even thus he passed through the red gates
of strife
From earthly crowns and palms, to an immor-
tal life.
•
A brother bore his body from the field, 
And gave it unto stranger's hands, that closed
The calm blue eyes, on earth forever sealed,
And tenderly the slender limbs composed:
Strangers, yet sisters, who, with Mary's love, 
Sat by the open tomb, and weeping, looked
above.
