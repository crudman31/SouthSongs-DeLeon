Jackson.
Not 'mid the lightning of the stormy fight,
Not in the rush upon the vandal foe,
Did kingly Death, with his reistless might,
Lay the Great Leader low.
•
His warrior soul its earthly shackles broke
In the full sunshine of a peaceful town.
When all the storm was hushed, the trusty oak
That propped our cause went down.
•
Though his alone the blood that flecks the ground,
Recording all his grand, heroic deeds, 
Freedom herself is writhing with the wound,
And all the country bleeds.
•
He entered not the Nation's promised Land,
At the red belching of the cannon's mouth;
But broke the House of Bondage with his hand-
The Moses of the South!
•
O gracious God! not gainless is the loss:
A glorious sunbeam golds thy sternest frown;
And, while his country staggers with the Cross,
He rises with the Crown!
