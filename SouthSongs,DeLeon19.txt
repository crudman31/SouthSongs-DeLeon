Your Mission
____
And the lips of the mothers will bless you
As angels, sweet-visaged and pale!
And the little ones run to caress you,
While the wives and sisters cry "Hail!"
But e'en if you drop down unheeded,
What matter? God's ways are the best!
You have poured out your life where 't was needed,
And He will take care of the rest!
