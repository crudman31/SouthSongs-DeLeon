Preface.
-· ---•-• -· --
A BOOK without a preface is like a salad without salt; but in
offering the poems in this volume to the public, I can ad' d little
to what they speak for themselves.
The sole object of the collection is to make known a few
noble poems that belong rather to the world than to any particular
. section, and to show those who have read REBEL
RHYMES that
'' There's life in the old land yet''
to do higher and better things. 
Knowing that the South was surrounded during the war by
a Chinese wall, that hid many important points of her history
even from those beyond it, I was still surprised at the utter
ignorance in the North of her having produced any thing like
a high order of poetry. This ignorance extended, too, even to
those whose principles or sympathies made them peer, with
straining eyes, through every possible crevice in the barrier.
It is with diffidence, proportioned to the difficulties that surround
it, that I have approached the task. The garland is to
be gathered from a field extensive and teeming with a rank
luxuriance of growth, that it must often puzzle the analyst to
separate from the really valuable.
Little as is known of it, ancl confined, as it has ever been,
to particular cliques, there is yet much latent literature in the
South. The terrible friction, however, so long and so roughly
applied, brought only the metrical element to the surface.
