The Hero without a Name.
I loved, when a child, to seek the page
Where war's proud tales are grandly told,
And to read of the might of that former age,
In the brave, good days of old;
When men for virtue and Honor fought
In serried ranks, 'neath their banners bright,
By teh fairty hands of beauty wrought,
and broidered with "God and Right."
•
'Twas there I read of Sir Launcelot true,
Whose deeds have been sung in a nolber strain;
And of Roderic, the Bold, who his falchion drew,
In the cause of his native Spain;
And, in thought, I beheld gay Sideny ride-
His white plume dotting the field's expanse;
And Bayard, who came like the swirl of the tide,
As he struck for the lilies of France.

On the crags of Scotland then I saw,
With his hair of golden hue, Montrose;
And the swarthy Douglas, whose name was law
In the homes of his English foes.
