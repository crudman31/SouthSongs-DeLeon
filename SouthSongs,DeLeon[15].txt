SOUTH SONGS.
Your Mission
Fold away all your bright-tinted dresses,
Turn the key on your jewels to-day,
And the wealth of your tendril-like tresses
Braid back, in a serious way :
No more delicate gloves-no more laces,
No more trifling in boudoir or bower;
But come with your souls in your faces-
To meet the stern needs of the hour !

Look around ! By the torch-light unsteady,
The dead and the dying seem one.
What ! paling and trembling already,
Before your dear mission's begun?â€¢
These wounds are more precious than ghastly; 
Time presses her lips to each scar,
