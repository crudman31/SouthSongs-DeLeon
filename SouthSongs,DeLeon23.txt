The Guerrillas.
Awake and to horse! my brothers,
For the dawn is glimmering gray,
And hark! in the crackling brushwood
There are feet that treat this way!
•
"Who cometh?" "A friend!" "What tidings?"
"O God! I sicken to tell;
For the earth seems earth no longer,
And its sights are sights of hell!
•
"There's rapine, and fire, and slaughter,
From the mountain down to the shore;
There's blood on the trampled harvest,
And blood on the homestead floor!
•
"From the far off conquered cities
Come the voice of a stifled wail,
And the shrieks and moans of the houseless
Ring out, like a dirge, on the gale!
•
"I've seen, from the smoking village 
Our mothers and daughters fly!
