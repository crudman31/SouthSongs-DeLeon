The Burtial of Latane.
____
A little child strewed roses on his bier-
Pale roses, not ,pre stainless than his soul,
Nor yet more fragrant than his life sincere,
That blossomed with good actions-brief, but
whole;
The aged matron and the faithful slave
Approached, with reverent feet, the hero's
lowely grave.
•
No man of God might say the burial rite
Above the "rebel"-thus declared the foe
That blanched before him in the deadly fight;
But woman's voice, with accents soft and low,
Trembling with pity-touched with pathos-
read
Over his hallowed dust the ritual for the dead.
•
"Tis sown in weakness, it is raised in power!"
Softly the promise floated on the air,
While the low breathings of the sunset hour
Came back responsive to the mourner's prayer.
Gently they laid him underneath the sod,
And left him with his fame, his country, and
his God!
